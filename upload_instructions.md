# Hostinger Integration Instructions

## 1. Portal Page (NEW - Recommended)
To see all your apps in one place, upload the new **`portal.html`**.

1.  **Upload** `public/portal.html` to your Hostinger `public_html` folder.
2.  **Visit** `arraylink.ai/portal.html`
3.  You will see a menu to choose between "Voice Agent" and "US Travel".

## 2. Flight App Deployment
(If you haven't already done this)
1.  Upload the `US-travel` folder to `public_html`.
2.  **Direct Access:** You can always visit `arraylink.ai/US-travel/` directly to see the app, even without the portal.

## 3. Backend Files
Make sure your `php`, `.env`, and `.htaccess` are in the root `public_html` for the Voice Agent to work.
