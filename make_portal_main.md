# How to Make the Portal Your Main Page

To see the "Multi-App Menu" when you open `arraylink.ai`, you need to replace your current main file.

### Step-by-Step for Hostinger

1.  **Rename the Old Main Page**
    *   Go to Hostinger File Manager -> `public_html`.
    *   Find the existing `index.html` file.
    *   Right-click and **Rename** it to **`voice.html`**.
    *   *(This saves your old site so it's not lost!)*

2.  **Upload the New Main Page**
    *   Locate the file `public/portal.html` on your computer.
    *   **Rename** it locally to **`index.html`**.
    *   **Upload** this new `index.html` to Hostinger `public_html`.

### Result
*   **`arraylink.ai`** → Shows the **Portal Menu**.
*   **Clicking "Voice Sales Agent"** → Goes to `voice.html` (Your old home page).
*   **Clicking "US Travel"** → Goes to `/US-travel/`.
